NAME
    CPAN::Mini::Tested - create a CPAN mirror using modules that have passed
    tests

REQUIREMENTS
    This module is designed for Perl 5.6.1. The following non-core
    modules are required:

      Cache::Simple::TimedExpiry
      CPAN::Mini
      DBI
      DBD::SQLite
      LWP
      Regexp::Assemble

Installation
    Installation can be done using the traditional Makefile.PL or the
    newer Build.PL methods.

    Using Makefile.PL:

      perl Makefile.PL
      make
      make test
      make install

    (On Windows platforms you should use nmake instead.)

    Using Build.PL (if you have Module::Build installed):

      perl Build.PL
      perl Build
      perl Build test
      perl Build install

SYNOPSYS
      use CPAN::Mini::Tested;

      CPAN::Mini::Tested->update_mirror(
       remote => "http://cpan.mirrors.comintern.su",
       local  => "/usr/share/mirrors/cpan",
       trace  => 1
      );

DESCRIPTION
    This module is a subclass of CPAN::Mini which checks the CPAN Testers
    database for passing tests of that distribution on your platform.
    Distributions will only be downloaded if there are passing tests.

    The major differences are that it will download the testers.db file from
    the CPAN Testers web site when updating indices, and it will check if a
    distribution has passed tests in the specified platform before applying
    other filtering rules to it.

    See the module documentation for more information.
